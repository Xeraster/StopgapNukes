15kt-atomic-bomb=A 15kt full nuclear fission bomb in rocket form. This weapon completely obliterates everything in a 1km radius and causes substantial damage to anything within a 4.5km radius. This weapon should never be fired from a handheld rocket launcher. \n[color=#ec0800]!!!Use with extreme caution!!![/color]\n[color=#eeee00]This weapon is so powerful and dangerous that it has little practical use. You will probably die if you use fire this. It is recommended to use 1kt rockets instead.[/color]
thermobaric-rocket=a fuel air bomb, also known as a thermobaric weapon. It ignites the atmosphere around it on fire making a big huge firey explosion. It's basically a flamethrower in bomb form. Fuel air bombs are an invaluable tool when dealing with stronger-than-vanilla biters or extreme biter spread settings.
neutron-reflector=Neutron reflectors are used in the production of high-efficiency nuclear fission bombs that can enhance the yield of the weapon. They work by reflecting neutrons back into the core of the bomb, causing more fission reactions which increases the overall destructive power.
1kt-atomic-bomb=A fission bomb with a 1kt yield.\nCapable of destroying multiple nearby bases, and crippling bases in a huge area, completely vaporizing everything within a 600m radius and damaging everything within 1.4km. \n[color=#ec0800]!!!Use with extreme caution!!![/color]\n[color=#eeee00]This weapon is practially unusable without either the aircraft mod or the AAI remote control vehicles mod.[/color][color=#eeee00]Do not attempt to fire this from a handheld rocket launcher unless you want to die.[/color]
1kt-nuclear-artillery-shell=A nuclear artillery shell with a 1kt yield.\nCapable of destroying multiple nearby bases, and crippling bases in a huge area, completely vaporizing everything within a 600m radius and damaging everything within 1.4km. \n[color=#ec0800]!!!Use with extreme caution!!![/color]\n[color=#eeee00]This will destroy the artillery turret that fires it even if at maximum range.[/color]
thermonuclear-bomb=You probably shouldn't do it. This 2 megaton thermonuclear bomb destroys everything in a 7km radius and damages damn near everything in the world. Just don't do it.
fusion-bomb=A fusion weapon that harnesses the power of fusion to make a mind-blowingly gigantic explosion. Full fusion weapons astronomically more efficient than thermonuclear fusion weapons. This thing is so absurdly powerful that it essentially has no practical use. The only purpose of even building one of these is for shits and giggles pretty much.\n This weapon has a blast yield of roughly 100 megatons.\n [color=#ec0800]!!!Use with extreme caution. This will cause lots of lag and probably destroy everything on the surface of the planet!!![/color]

medium_nuclear_cannon_shell=A boosted tactical nuke in a cannon shell with a blast yield equivalent to 120 tons of TNT.
big_atomic_bomb=A boosted tactical nuke in rocket form with a blast yield equivalent to 20 tons of TNT.
medium_atomic_bomb=A very large tactical nuke in rocket form with a blast equivalent to 120 tons of TNT.
15kt-nuclear-artillery-shell=A 15kt full nuclear fission bomb packed into an artillery shell. This weapon completely obliterates everything in a 1km radius and causes substantial damage to anything within a 4.5km radius. This weapon is absolutely stupid and whatever you're planning on using this for is probably a really bad idea. \n[color=#ec0800]!!!Use with extreme caution!!![/color]\n[color=#eeee00]This weapon is so powerful and dangerous that it has little practical use. You will probably die if you use fire this. It is recommended to use 1kt rockets and use the Aircraft mod.[/color]
500kt-atomic-bomb=Approximately 1/4th as powerful as the thermonuclear bomb. It is almost possible for modern pcs to handle this one but seriously you should just use the 15kt atomic bomb instead. The lag is not worth it and the 15kt atomic bomb will destroy entire bases just fine. This vaporizes everything in a 2km radius and damages everything in a 9km radius.

girdler-sulfide=Girdler Sulfide process

[technology-description]
large-atomic-bomb=An advanced atomic bomb is a powerful nuclear weapon that uses the energy released by nuclear fission to create an enormous explosion. Unlike traditional explosives, which rely on chemical reactions to create a blast, nuclear weapons release immense amounts of energy through the splitting of atoms. This process releases massive amounts of energy in the form of heat and kinetic energy, making these weapons incredibly destructive.
thermobarics=A fuel air bomb, also known as a thermobaric weapon, is a type of explosive that utilizes oxygen from the surrounding environment to create a massive explosion. The device works by mixing fuel with air and creating a highly combustible mixture that can be detonated with a small amount of explosive material. When the bomb detonates, it creates a massive shockwave that can destroy structures and cause severe damage over a large area.
thermonuclear-fusion=Unlock the all-powerful thermonuclear bomb.
full-fusion-weapons=Full fusion weapons. Much more powerful and much more compact.
girdler-sulfide=Uses hydrogen sulfide[fluid=hydrogen-sulfide] to concentrate heavy water[fluid=heavy-water] before boiling it. Much more energy efficient than boiling water[fluid=water] directly

stopgapnukes_thermobaricpollution_behaviour=Multiplier value for pollution for thermobaric/fuel air bombs. Higher values mean more pollution.
stopgapnukes_atomicpollution_behaviour=Multiplier value for pollution for atomic bombs. Higher values mean more pollution.
stopgapnukes_thermobaric_cliff_radius_behaviour=Higher values destroy more cliffs, up to 50% more than the total blast radius.
stopgapnukes_atomic_cliff_radius_behaviour=Higher values destroy more cliffs, up to the total blast radius.
stopgapnukes_basic_heavy_water_time_behaviour=Base value for how long it takes the basic (non girdler-sulfide) heavy water recipe to craft.
stopgapnukes_basic_heavy_water_requirement_behaviour=Multiplier for how much heavy water is required for most recipes involving heavy water.
stopgapnukes_advanced_cannon_shell_heavy_water_neutronplates_behaviour=Whether or not the heavy water version of of advanced nuclear cannon shell requires neutron reflectors. Neutron reflectors need tungsten but if you aren't playing space age, this option won't do anything.
stopgapnukes_20t_effects_behaviour=The 20 ton atomic bomb explosion is optimized enough that you probably don't need to uncheck this.
stopgapnukes_1kt_effects_behaviour=LARGELY NO LONGER NEEDED. Spawn additional 1kt explosion effects. Enabling this is almost a guarenteed unrecoverable game freeze. Disabling this means it will use True Nukes effects that are less laggy and better.
stopgapnukes_neutronplate_tungsten_behaviour=If using space age, unchecking this reverts to the non-space age neutron plate recipe. This option doesn't do anything if Space Age is not enabled and installed.
stopgapnukes_medium_nuke_fireball_behaviour=How much damage to apply to things near the center of the 20 ton nuclear explosions. Damage values are capped at 500000 because setting them higher causes it to get rounded to zero for some reason.

stopgapnukes_boosted_fission_tech_behaviour=Setting this to false unlocks the 500kt boosted fission bomb with the "advanced nuclear weapons" tech research. Setting this to true unlocks the 500kt boosted fission bomb with the "thermonuclear bomb" tech research.
stopgapnukes_vanila_recipe_amount_behaviour=In vanilla this value is 30. In space-age this value is 100. The vanilla atomic bomb explosion is a complete joke and not worth 100 uranium, so set this to whatever you want. Values between 1 and 10000 inclusive are accepted.
stopgapnukes_secondary_blast_damage_amt=If this is set to a number greater than zero (0), the amount of damage done within the secondary blast radius of the 1kt, 15kt, 500kt and 2mt explosions will be limited to this number. If set to -1, the secondary explosion damage will be set to zero (0) for most explosions. Does not modify the damage done in the center fireball of the blast. Not recommended for most players as these explosions are dificult to fine-tune and easy to mess up. If you break your nukes with this just set it back to 0, but post about it too so the issue can get fixed.
