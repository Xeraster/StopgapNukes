Stopgap Nukes expansion for Factorio 1.1
https://mods.factorio.com/mod/StopgapNukes

Besides mod compatibility patches or adding different nukes, this mod is probably as sophisticated as it's ever going to get without outside help from the Factorio modding community. Here is a wishlist of things I wish I could add but can't figure out how:
- explosion effects that are as good as in True Nukes
- make the explosions as efficient as in True Nukes. You can't realistically use anything larger than the 15kt nuke without it crashing your game in Stopgap Nukes. True Nukes has really efficient and sophisticated explosion code but I have not yet found a way to either reuse that code or make my own that's at least almost as good.
- there is a bug where in map mode, if you open the crafting menu, nukes added by this mod WON'T show the ingredients to make them in the tooltip. Items added by other mods sometimes don't have this bug. The vanilla nuke doesn't have this bug, but there seems to be no way for custom items that I make to show their ingredients in the tooltip menu in map mode. I have no idea why and I haven't been able to find exactly what other mods do differently that allow their mapmode tooltips to work correctly and I give up trying to fix it, any help or suggestions would be appreciated.
